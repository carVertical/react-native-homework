## Requirements

- [ ] Create API endpoints mocks to simulate backend for this feature. Something like:
  ```js
  const mockedCoupons = ....
  const getCoupons = () => Promise.resolve(mockedCoupons);
  const updateCoupon = (coupon) => Promise.resolve(updateCoupon(coupon));
- [ ] Implement all provided screens. Just the general behavior is enough, don’t linger over the details
- [ ] Write at least one test
- [ ] Share code as a private repo on GitHub. Add [@arnasjozonis](https://github.com/arnasjozonis) as a collaborators for review
- [ ] Include instructions on how to test the app in `README`. If TestFlight is used, send invites to _alex at carvertical dot com_ and _arnasjozonis at carvertical dot com_

## Notes

- You can bootstrap the app however you want
- If you’re unsure on how some interaction should work, just use your best judgement
